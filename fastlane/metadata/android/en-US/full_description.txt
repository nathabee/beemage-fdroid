BeeMage is a client-side image-processing playground.

Build, run, and understand visual pipelines—from outlines to masks and SVG-like results—directly on your device.
No uploads. No server processing.

Best results with high-contrast subjects such as drawings, silhouettes, scanned artwork, and photos with clear edges.
